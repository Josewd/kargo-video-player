# kargo-video-player

**Requirements:**

**Core Functionality**:
   - The video player should support basic controls: play, pause, and a progress bar.

   - The progress bar does not need to be interactive (i.e., users shouldn't be able to click on it to skip to a different part of the video).

   - Every 30 seconds, the video should automatically pause and play a short, non-skippable ad. For the purpose of this demo, you can use any short video file as the "ad".
